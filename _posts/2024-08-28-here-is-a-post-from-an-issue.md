Here is a proof of concept to use github issues as a content management system, and github actions as a build server to push out a jekyll site on github pages.

## Why?

I wanted to see what else I could do with github actions.  The cron schedule thing is super interesting, and being able to run tasks and then have a static site rendered is very cool.

## Uh this is missing a lot of stuff

It sure it.  Like I think anyone can create an issue now?  And comments don't show up on the blog, that would be fun to see.

Other ideas would be to add labels as tags, and add comments onto the generated side that would link back to the github side of things.
